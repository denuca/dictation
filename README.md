# Dictation
A python script that creates a PowerPoint dictation file from a given input text.
The dictation file, splits each words and punctuation from the input text and frame them in a box (a black box for words and a blue box for punctuation).
Each words and punctuation will be displayed in white on a white background, and its box width will fit the text.
Once the PPT has been generated each boxes (PPT text object) can be animated to change the colour.
